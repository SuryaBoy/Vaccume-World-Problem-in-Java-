# Vaccume-World-Problem-in-Java-
here vaccume world problem is simulated in java.
It is done in an Object oriented approach
there is a class called agent
class called location
class called vaccumemain
class called Main class consisting of main function
the agent has its location either left or right
the agent sucks the dirt
the agent scans for dirt
the agent can change its location
the location has its name either left or right
and a boolean variable isdirty can be true or false
the vaccumemain class is like a vaccume world which integrates agent and location
and has a run method where agent starts scanning and sucking dirt
The program doesnt implement GUI till now
The console output is used to inform about the states, scanning , sucking and changing location process
There is extra class in the program called state which hasnt been used.
